            <p> In spite of sometimes looking like the typical programmer, I don't actually live in a basement! Actually, people often said that I should pick something else to study, they said I would hate working with IT. However they don't know that I love programming, computers and the logic behind it all. That's why I'm on a mission to combat the prejudices against "the average programmer". That's why I love KEA, the place where I study Data Science, as it gathers all kinds of epic people! </p>

        <p> In my daily life I enjoy drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. I'm usually compared to an old person, and perhaps it's due to me spending a lot of time with my grandparents when I grew up. My grandfather was actually the person who made me interested in programming, as he was one of the first to work with IT in Denmark, after moving here from Syria in the 70's. </p>

        <p> We're living under the fourth industrial revolution, with AI technology and mass data comprehension ahead. Kids are spending hours and hours on watching mindless TikTok content, specially suited by algorithms for the perfect entertainment... or is it? Many questions arise, of the ethical and political kind, but all I know is that I love semiconductors and supercomputers. Bring it on! </p>
